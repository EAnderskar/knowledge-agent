# Knowledge Agent

This project is about building an AI-powered research agent that can gather, analyze, and visualize information from multiple sources.  
The agent is designed to connect to different tools using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and combines modern techniques such as **RAG** and **knowledge graphs**.

## ðŸš€ Project Goal
The goal is to create a modular and extensible agent that:
- Uses **web search** and **SQL queries** for structured and unstructured data
- Retrieves and enriches context through **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- Explores relationships using a **knowledge graph**
- Visualizes results with plots and graphs

This project is part of my learning journey to deepen my skills as an AI/ML engineer and demonstrate how to design and implement advanced agent systems.

## ðŸ“… Timeline
The project will be developed step by step during Q4:
- **October:** Agent setup, web search, SQL queries, plotting
- **November:** Add RAG and knowledge graph capabilities
- **December:** Full integration, visualization, and project polish

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain / CrewAI (for agent orchestration)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- FAISS / Chroma (for RAG)
- Neo4j / NetworkX (for knowledge graph)
- Matplotlib / PyVis (for visualization)
